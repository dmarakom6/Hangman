info = "Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players.\nOne player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses"

history = "Though the origins of the game are unknown, a variant is mentioned in a book of children's games assembled by Alice Gomme in 1894.\nThis version lacks the image of a hanged man, instead relying on keeping score as to the number of attempts it took each player to fill in the blanks."

rules = "The CPU generates a random word.\nYou have 6 guesses."

maker = "About the maker:\nJim Marakomihelakis\nemail: dmarakom@gmail.com\nFind me on Quora, Repl.it and Github."

strategy = "The fact that the twelve most commonly occurring letters in the English language are e-t-a-o-i-n-s-h-r-d-l-u (from most to least), along with other letter-frequency lists, are used by the guessing player to increase the odds when it is their turn to guess.\nOn the other hand, the same lists can be used by the puzzle setter to stump their opponent by choosing a word that deliberately avoids common letters (e.g. rhythm or zephyr) or one that contains rare letters (e.g. jazz)."
